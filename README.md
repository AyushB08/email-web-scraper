# email-web-scraper
 Code uses the BeautifulSoup and requests library in Python to scrape a webpage and extract all the email addresses. I found this approach very useful for cold emailing. Follow the comments within the code for guidance on how to use it. The current code in the repository gathers emails from the computer science and engineering department at a few colleges. Feel free to change the url. Made on PyCharm.
